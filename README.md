# Introduction

A small collection of some useful bash scripts of mine:

- **create-loopback-file** : create a loopback file with progress feddback.
- **disable-sim-pin**      : disable sim PIN request.
- **mount-onedrive**       : mount OneDrive by **rclone**.
- **process-sentinel**     : monitor a program/application showing a notification when started and stopped (useful for long running backup jobs).
- **processes-sentinel**   : monitor multiple programs in one short.
- **show-swap-usage**      : show swap usage for all processes or for a given PID. 
- **snap-purge**           : remove all outdated packages.
