# Introduction

A small collection of some useful bash scripts of mine:

- **disable-sim-pin**    : disable sim PIN request.
- **mount-onedrive**     : mount OneDrive by **rclone**.
- **process-sentinel**   : monitor a program/application showing a notification when started and stopped (useful for long running backup jobs).
- **processes-sentinel** : monitor multiple programs in one short.
- **show-swap-usage**    : show swap usage for all processes or for a given PID.
