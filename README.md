# Introduction

A small collection of some useful bash scripts of mine:

- **disable-sim-pin**                : disable sim PIN request.
- **dump-virtualbox-machine-memory** : dump Virtualbox machine memory for GDB core inspection.
- **mount-onedrive**                 : mount OneDrive by **rclone**.
- **process-sentinel**               : monitor a program/application showing a notification when started and stopped (useful for long running backup jobs).
- **processes-sentinel**             : monitor multiple programs in one short.
- **show-swap-usage**                : show swap usage for all processes or for a given PID.
